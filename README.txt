# Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) Implementation

## Overview

Implementing a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH), a binary tree facilitating efficient geometric shape searches in a 2D space. BVH is crucial in graphics, particularly ray tracing, to quickly identify intersecting objects. The BVH structure involves internal nodes storing bounding boxes and leaf nodes containing triangles.

## Features

- **BVH Operations:** Build, insert, remove triangles, find collisions, and identify intersections with rays.
- **Visualization:** Utilize the Visualization class for GUI representation, incorporating BVH functionality for calculating visible pixels.
- **Testing Suite:** Rigorous testing, including a suite to ensure correctness.

## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the BVH project. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and libraries.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bvh-project.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd bvh-project
